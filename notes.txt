- better of injecting the repository in the resource, what am i missing?
- tried to get away with not having an id is the movie, failed so going to change that
- geb bit too ambitious, should of stayed with what i know bit off too much
- checkstyle import control seems to work well
- movie has one or more reviews
- most time spent around the core not in it
- need some info about why multitier architecture is poor
	- not just 2 ports, lots confuses and blurs the lines
	- natural sepage into other layers
	- difficult to test and extend
